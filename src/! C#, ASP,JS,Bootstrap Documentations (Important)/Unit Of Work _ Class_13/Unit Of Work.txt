Unit Of Work
we can put repository instead of these functions
because repository has create update delete
----------------------------------------
# DbSet is just like this, it has create update delete and save changes

# So DbContext uses unito of work and Repository patern combinedly



# It maintains Transactions (DataBase Transaction)

The Unit of Work (UoW) pattern in ASP.NET is a design pattern that manages database transactions 
to ensure data consistency and integrity. It keeps track of changes to entities and coordinates 
the writing out of these changes as a single transaction.

Why Use Unit of Work?
Consistency: Ensures that a series of operations are either all committed or all rolled back.
Performance: Reduces the number of database calls by batching operations.
Maintainability: Encapsulates database operations, making code more modular and testable.

Key Components
Unit of Work Interface (IUnitOfWork): Defines the contract for the Unit of Work.
Unit of Work Implementation (UnitOfWork): Implements the IUnitOfWork interface.
Repositories: Handle data access for specific entities.
