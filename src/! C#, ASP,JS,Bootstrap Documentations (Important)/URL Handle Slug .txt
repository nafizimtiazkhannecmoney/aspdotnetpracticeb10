Yes, in software development, especially web development, URL handles are often used like IDs, and there's a 
strong trend and best practice to make them SEO-friendly by including keywords 
and human-readable slugs instead of just numerical IDs.


Using URL Handles Like IDs:

Unique Identification: Just like a database ID uniquely identifies a resource (e.g., a product, a blog post, a user), a well-designed URL handle can serve as a unique identifier for that resource on the web.   
Retrieval Mechanism: When a user clicks on a link or a web application makes a request to a specific URL, the server-side code parses the URL handle to identify which specific resource needs to be retrieved and displayed.
State Management (Sometimes): In some single-page applications (SPAs) or web applications with complex routing, the URL handle can also encode information about the current state or view.   
Making URLs SEO-Friendly:

Using descriptive, keyword-rich slugs in URLs instead of just numerical IDs offers significant benefits for Search Engine Optimization (SEO):   

Improved Readability for Users: Human-readable URLs are easier for users to understand at a glance what the page is about before they even click on it. This can improve click-through rates from search results and social media.   
Keyword Inclusion: By including relevant keywords in the URL, you signal to search engines what the content of the page is about. This can help improve the page's ranking for those keywords. For example, www.example.com/products/running-shoes-mens-blue is much more informative than www.example.com/products/1234.   
Better Link Equity Distribution: When other websites link to your pages using descriptive anchor text that matches your URL slugs, it can help pass link equity (a ranking factor) more effectively.
Enhanced Social Sharing: Descriptive URLs look cleaner and are more likely to be shared on social media platforms.   
Common Practices for SEO-Friendly URL Handles:

Using Relevant Keywords: Include the main keywords that describe the content of the page.   
Creating Slugs: Convert titles or names into URL-friendly strings by:
Lowercasing all letters.
Replacing spaces with hyphens (-).   
Removing special characters and punctuation.   
Filtering out stop words (e.g., "the," "a," "is").
Keeping URLs Concise: While descriptive, try to keep URLs reasonably short and to the point.   
Using Canonical URLs: For pages with potentially multiple URLs that show the same content (e.g., with different parameters), use canonical URLs (<link rel="canonical" href="...">) to tell search engines which version is the preferred one.   
Consistent URL Structure: Maintain a consistent and logical URL structure across your website.
Example:

Instead of:

www.example.com/product.php?id=567
www.example.com/article/123
You would use:

www.example.com/products/mens-leather-jacket   
www.example.com/blog/how-to-optimize-website-speed
Technical Implementation:

Web frameworks and Content Management Systems (CMS) often provide features and tools to easily create and manage SEO-friendly URL handles (sometimes called slugs or permalinks). This typically involves:   

URL Routing: Defining how URLs map to specific code or content on the server.
Slug Generation: Automatically generating URL-friendly slugs from content titles.
Parameter Handling: Extracting information from the URL handle to identify the specific resource.
In summary, in modern web development, using URL handles that are both functional as identifiers and SEO-friendly is a widely adopted best practice. It improves user experience, helps search engines understand your content better, and ultimately contributes to better website visibility and traffic.
