We dont wat multiple instances of the same object. Suppose we are using database class
# So we can make the constructor private, thus we cannot make instances
# We need an instance to work
# We can make a get property but we can also make getinstance() functions.
# If it is uninitialited then it is initialized and if it is initialized then we return the 
  instance 

# So now If we make 2 instance we will see that both of them holds the same value
