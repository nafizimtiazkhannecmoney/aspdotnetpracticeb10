# We use Factory Design Pattern so that we dont can create obj fast(When the obj is large)

centralized function where it creates obj, and reduces pain, we dont have to make obj again and again

# So factory patern helps us not to repeat any tasks to make obj

# We make a function and it will initialize the obj and fill it by itself for us
