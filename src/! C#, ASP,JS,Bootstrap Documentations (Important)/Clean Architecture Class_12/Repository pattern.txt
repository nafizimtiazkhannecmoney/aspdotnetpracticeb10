public interface Repository<T>
{
  List<T> readAll();
  T read(Criteria criteria);
  T create(T entity);
  T update(T entity);
  T delete(T entity); 
}



Every Aggregate root will have a Repository (Blog Post will have a repository, but not for Comment)

the topic was under course and we took the course but we didnot enter topic.


So DBContext follows Repository Pattern.
DBSet follows Repository Pattern
